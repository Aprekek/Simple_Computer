- Lines must be numbered in order;
- A variable name consists of only one letter (A-Z);
- Variables only work with integers;
- Expressions for "LET" work only with variables;
- "IF" only supports 3 conventional characters: '>', '<', '='
- In “IF”, the expressions to the left and right of the symbol must be in brackets, for example: 01 IF (A) > (B + C) WRITE A
- The program should end with the word "END" and "HALT" for the base and assembler, respectively
